#SimpleMonteCarlo

A simple implementation of the MonteCarlo algorithm in Python. Feed it 1-bit (2 color) black and white images and it will calculate the % area taken up by black. This allows you to approximate the area of weird shapes not defined by an equation. Just multiply the area of the image you feed this by the % result you get at the end, and you'll get an approximation of the area of your weird shape.
