# SimpleMonteCarlo
A simple implementation of the MonteCarlo algorithm in Python. Feed it a 1-bit (2 color) black and white image like the one below and it will calculate the % area of black color. This allows you to approximate the area of weird shapes not defined by equations. Just multiply the area of the image you feed this by the % result you get at the end, and you'll get an approximation of the area of your weird shape.
